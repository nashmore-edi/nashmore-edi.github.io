Tutor on multiple undergraduate and graduate level courses in the hydrogeology program at the University of Edinburgh. Courses include fundamentals of hydrogeology, development of numerical models in Python, MODFLOW and OpenGeoSys, desktop environmental site assessment and field methods in hydrogeology.

## Hydrogeology 1: Applied Hydrogeology
_Course Instructor: Dr. Chris McDermott_
* Planned and delivered multiple problem-based tutorials each week, including solved problems on the board

## Hydrogeology 2: Simulation of Groundwater Flow and Transport
_Course Instructor: Dr Chris McDermott_
* Facilitated weekly tutorials on groundwater modeling using OpenGeoSys, helping students with problem solving, input file creation and debugging

## Topical Themes in GeoEngineering
_Course Instructor: Dr Chris McDermott_
* Facilitated weekly tutorials on regional groundwater flow modelling within various geoengineering scenarios using OpenGeoSys

## Computational Simulation of Groundwater Flow
*Course Instructor: Dr. Ian Molnar*
* Facilitated weekly tutorials on creating a groundwater flow numerical model using Python
* Assisted students after hours with code debugging

## Environmental Site Assessment Project
_Course Instructor: Dr. Ian Molnar_
* Led weekly tutorials on writing an environmental site assessment report including numerical modeling in Visual MODFLOW and desktop investigation
* Assisted with field work consisting of site characterization, water level readings, slug tests and pump tests
