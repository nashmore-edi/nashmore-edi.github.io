excerpt: 'Environmental monitoring for gas migration at suspected or impacted sites commonly rely on groundwater monitoring using aqueous samples analyzed fo dissolved gas concentrations. Multicomponent gas ratios are commonly used for characterization, but there is no standardized approach for calculating these ratios. This commentary recommends a standardized approach for the calculation of gas ratios used for GM investigations.'

Environmental monitoring for gas migration at suspected or impacted sites commonly rely on groundwater monitoring using aqueous samples analyzed fo dissolved gas concentrations. Multicomponent gas ratios are commonly used for characterization, but there is no standardized approach for calculating these ratios. This commentary recommends a standardized approach for the calculation of gas ratios used for GM investigations. This work ties in to the 'DE-GAS Toolkit' developed by GSI Environmental for the evaluation of dissolved hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gas data. The toolkit is available at https://www.gsienv.com/software/other-models-and-tools/de-gas-toolkit/.
